#csSession contains it al

#comment keep in csettings

#csSettings clss basing on:
class settingsConnector():
    # used in local and non-local.

#so CS_Settings.<method>
# or local = CS_Settings.local()
# local.<method>
# using class inheritance
    
# cs split in:
#core/
#   main.py
#   ...
    
# so can be used with <session>.core instead of importing cslib
    
# return() builtin for returning data as obj-links example: <dict_4921041> or <dict4@921041> or #4921041,
# theese can be used to send objs through pipeline wihtout parsing-mashing them.
    
# Buffer-out should also append al output from final-pipelines so:
# print h | num       : 14
# print h || print o  : h, o
    
# execution modules should implement a execute function/method and be dyn-imported rather then executed.

# diffrent modules of crosshell like exec/interp/console should be executed with just session in scope not sharing global, this ofc needs more implements in session.
    
# session should be re-structured to have exportable-data sepparate in f-ex <session>.data[...]

# datatype lockable_dict that can be locked/readonly either thorugh custom class or pythonic implementation
