Fix commentkeeper to properly handle changed dict size

/Flag support for sinput args

in langlsit.json, readfiles.json and such path lists, they should use a placeholder for path.

make v2 completer to allow <path>/<cmdlet/<file>/<folder> type-completions for cmdlets.

allow loading custom completers through modulo-packages

make sure namespaces in dynprefix and similar are autofilled as pkg-name

restructure al of crosshell to make them only share required scopes.
allowing import of just cslib

add a file for custom deffinitions like print/input/exit/include, they should be named descriptive names

make include() for modules

allow formatted descriptions:
#st-fdesc
#en-fdesc
/
fdesc: {}
that get converted into a oneline string with placeholder for \n
theese can work as "man"-pages
