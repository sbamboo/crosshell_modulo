- Rewrite package loader with the steps:
    1. Path discovery
    2. Package discovery
    3. Data loader (with setting for cmdlets or modules, so you can choose what to load, to support future "fine-adjust" refresh cmd)

  Modulo package loaders can also be defined to use a few built in loader types:
    1. "mapping_1-1"
    2. "mapping_1-M"
    3. "register"
    4. "register_cmdlets"

  For example might core only define the reader-loader and cmdlet-loader while for example "dynprefix" could be defined by crosshell.

  Also optimize the loaders for example legacy with max-depth and auto-dot-skip in the recursion loop.
  And modulo to not be recursince unless specified in loadetype.

  This means a dict for defining loaders that contain "loaderType" and "recursive" types.
