- Make createAndReturn_startupW() use get max and incr values from some config, and clamp max if screen clamped, if so calc factor for confMax-clampedMax and divide incr with it

- make modularSettingsClass have optional stm/ptm class and use on getKeyPath as arg, and then remove the current parse-passes

- ensure everything uses getEncoding()

- make "stateInstance" class to allow for file-less modes where the states are also exported on session-export. Implement this for example in the modularSettingsLinker.
